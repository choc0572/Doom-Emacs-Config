# My Doom Emacs Configuration

Check out the [original repository](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) for Doom Emacs if you want to try it out!

## Setting up with Doom Emacs already installed:

1. If you already use Doom Emacs and you want to try my configuration, first clone this repository
2. Then replace the files in your `.doom.d` folder
3. Run `doom sync` in your terminal to install all the packages
4. Then run `doom doctor` in the terminal as well to ensure there are no issues with the installation
5. Checkout the `init.el` file to checkout the packages I have enabled.
